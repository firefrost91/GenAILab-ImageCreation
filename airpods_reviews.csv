Apple AirPods 4 with Active Noise Cancellation,5,Everett Walker,"Reviewed in the United States on October 31, 2025",Yes,"Fantastic, best pair of earbuds I've hadI love these AirPods, they integrate seamlessly into the Apple ecosystem. The noise cancellation is pretty great, although these do not have as good of a seal compared to earbuds that have rubber tips. Since they don't have the tips, they're also not going to be super comfortable for everyone. They're very comfortable for me, but it'll be different for every person. I don't mind the white color, but you can obviously get a different color case if you don't like it. I haven't tested mic quality yet myself, but I've heard the mic is solid. The audio quality is absolutely fantastic on these, going from my old earbuds to these felt like clearing water out of my ears and finally being able to hear clearly. These are some fantastic premium earbuds, and they're a great price as well."
Apple AirPods 4 with Active Noise Cancellation,5,Layne Lebleu,"Reviewed in the United States on November 25, 2025",Yes,"Big Improvement Over Older AirPods ModelsI bought these AirPods 4 for my wife because her old pair just wasn't holding a charge anymore, plus I needed something to get her for our anniversary...this was an EASY win! The battery life alone is a huge upgrade for her as she can go through a full day of use without stressing about topping them off. She's been talking a lot about the new features too. The noise cancelling is shockingly good for earbuds, and the audio passthrough mode is something she didn't think she'd use but now relies on all the time. If someone starts talking to her, the earbuds automatically let outside sound through so she doesn't have to keep taking them out. She's already saying she wants to upgrade her iPhone so she can use the Live Translation feature with these, which honestly I'm curious about too. These feel like a big step up from her old pair. Great sound, great battery life, and some very cool new features that make them worth it."
Apple AirPods 4 with Active Noise Cancellation,5,Jonathan C,"Reviewed in the United States on November 27, 2025",Yes,"Apple is qualityThe Apple AirPods 4 with Noise Cancellation are easily some of the best earbuds Apple has released. The sound quality is incredible. Everything is balanced, clean, and detailed, from the low-end to the highs. They feel like a major step forward, even for someone who has used every generation before this. The noise cancellation is outstanding. It blocks out background chatter, traffic, and general noise with a level of comfort that surprised me. These are perfect for people who want powerful noise reduction without the in-ear pressure or discomfort that some experience with the AirPods Pro (1–3). The open design solves that issue while still giving you premium audio and true isolation. The fit is secure, lightweight, and comfortable for long listening sessions. They stay in without forcing themselves into your ear canal, which makes them ideal for all-day wear. If you want top-tier sound, amazing noise cancellation, and a comfortable fit without the inner ear seal, the AirPods 4 are an easy recommendation. These feel like a refined version of everything people love about AirPods, taken to the next level."
Apple AirPods 4 with Active Noise Cancellation,5,Dylan Manzanares,"Reviewed in the United States on October 21, 2024",Yes,"Exactly as expected! (A subjective review, duh)I never take the time to write reviews because why spend so much time on something that will ultimately have no effect on my life? Well in this case, these Airpods have met and exceeded every single one of my expectations and I figured that was worth writing about. Important disclaimers: - OF COURSE this is a subjective opinion, because that is all a review is. Take it with a grain of salt. - Different products work better or worse for different people, it's just that simple. - When talking about noise cancelling headphones, it's important to consider them for what they are, not what we think they SHOULD be. THE FIT: OKAY. I am someone who has very small ear cannals. I have spent years trying to find earbuds that fit my ears comfortably. Silicone in-ear tips have always been extremely uncomfortable for me. That being said, I did own the first gen Airpods Pro for a couple of years before buying these Airpods 4. I wanted earbuds that I could exercise with, use for commuting, and use for blocking out sound when I'm at school or on an airplane. The airpods pro fit the bill, but I could only wear them for short periods of time before they would start to seriously hurt. On top of that, they would always slowly come out of my ears. It didn't matter what size of eartips I used. My ears are just NOT made for in-ear silicone tips. BUT THESE AIRPODS 4!!! Holy smokes they are so comfortable. They never fall out. I can wear them for hours at a time and not even notice them. I haven't worn a pair of Airpods this comfortable since the gen 2 Airpods. The 3's didn't work for me either, but somehow apple really cooked up the ideal fit for these Airpods 4. THE NOISE CANCELLATION: Okay. Obviously, these are NOT going to have the same level of noise reduction as in-ear earbuds because there is no seal created by any silicone tips. If Airpods Pros and silicone tips have always worked for you, just buy those. However, considering that the noise cancellation in these Airpods is ALL driven by software, I have been extremely impressed with the results. It reduces the white noise of annoying sounds like public trains, airplanes, etc. very effectively. While voices and other louder sounds aren't cancelled completely, when music is playing through the earbuds these noises are quite enough to hardly notice. For me, that's enough. I don't need complete silence, I have my over-ear noise cancelling headphones for that. THE SOUND QUALITY: When I say that I was blown away the first time I listened to music on these Airpods, I was NOT kidding. The amount of bass that they managed to pack in to such small, open-eared earbuds is frankly impressive. The sound profile allows for an incredible listening experience no matter what genre of music you listen to (I listen to a wide range of pop, folk, indie, and rap primarily). THE OVERALL VERDICT: These Airpods 4 with Active Noise Cancellation are exactly as I expected them to be. They fit extremely well, the ANC is very acceptable for what they are, and they sound amazing. That's not to mention the TINY case that they come in, making them so easy to slip anywhere. I have been looking for a solid pair of earbuds with ANC that work with my ears for the longest time now. I'm happy to say that these are everything I've ever wanted. If you have had issues with silicone ear-tip earbuds fitting you properly, then these are definitely worth a shot!"
Apple AirPods 4 with Active Noise Cancellation,5,Amazon Customer,,Yes,"My all day companion!I've been using the new AirPods 4 for a few weeks now, and they've easily become one of the most important gadgets in my daily routine. I use them for everything — morning calls, afternoon music, and evening podcasts — and they've exceeded my expectations in every possible way. The first thing I noticed is how comfortable they are. The redesigned shape feels lighter and more natural in my ears compared to older versions. I often wear them for hours during work calls or while listening to music at the gym, and they never feel heavy or cause discomfort. The shorter stem and touch controls are intuitive — I can quickly pause, skip, or answer calls without fumbling with my phone. For my business calls, the Voice Isolation feature has been a real lifesaver. I work from home, and there's often background noise — a fan running, a bit of traffic outside, or even my dog barking occasionally. The AirPods filter all that out so clearly that my colleagues often comment on how crisp my voice sounds. It's hard to believe how much clarity they can deliver in such a tiny package. Then there's the Active Noise Cancellation — simply phenomenal. Whether I'm on a flight or in a busy café, it blocks out the chaos and lets me focus on what I'm listening to. And when I need to stay aware of my surroundings, the Adaptive Audio automatically shifts into Transparency Mode, so I can hear people or announcements without taking the AirPods out. Music and movies sound incredible too. The Personalized Spatial Audio creates an immersive surround sound effect that makes everything feel more alive and dimensional. It's genuinely impressive how something so small can produce such rich and balanced sound. The battery life is solid — easily lasts me through multiple meetings and a long evening walk, and the compact charging case is a bonus. I love that it supports multiple charging options, including my Apple Watch charger. In short, these AirPods strike the perfect balance between convenience, quality, and comfort. They fit so seamlessly into my daily life that I hardly notice I'm wearing them — until I take them off and realize how quiet the world suddenly feels. If you use your earphones all day like I do, these are absolutely worth it."
