LEGO Star Wars AT-TE Walker 75337,5,Amazon Customer,"Reviewed in the United States on November 20, 2024",Yes,"One of the best Lego Star Wars sets currently availableThis is one of the best Lego Star Wars sets currently available, it is extremely well designed. It is solidly built and has great action features with the rotating main turret and bubble turrets, and stud shooters. The model stays together great, and the handle is super convenient. Most of all, I appreciate that there is so much space on the inside to fit many, many troopers and their equipment. The set also comes with an awesome minifigure selection. This set is very well rounded, and one of the best lego star wars sets in recent years.",,,

Everything arrived in good condition, but they just slapped a shipping label on the Lego box and shipped it.",,,
